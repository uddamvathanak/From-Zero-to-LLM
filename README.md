# From Zero to LLM ðŸš€
Welcome to **From Zero to LLM**, a journey into the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository serves as a personal learning diary, showcasing hands-on experiments, tutorials, and projects related to LLMs, including fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and real-world applications.

# What You'll Find Here:
- Learning Resources: Notes, tutorials, and guides for understanding LLM concepts.
- Fine-Tuning Projects: Code and experiments for fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific datasets.
- Prompt Engineering: Examples and best practices for crafting effective prompts.
- Applications: Real-world implementations of LLMs, such as text summarization, question answering, and code generation.
- Tools and Frameworks: Tutorials and use cases of tools like Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and LangChain.

# Goals:
- Document the learning process from the basics to advanced techniques.
- Create a resource hub for those exploring the potential of LLMs.
- Share insights, challenges, and successes in working with state-of-the-art models.
